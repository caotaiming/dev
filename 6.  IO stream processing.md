### 6. IO stream processing

Kubernetes provides functions such as kubectl exec/attach/port-forward to enable direct interaction between the user and a specific Pod or container. As follows:

```sh
aster $ kubectl exec -it shell-demo -- /bin/bash
root@shell-demo:/# ls
bin   dev  home  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
boot  etc  lib   media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
root@shell-demo:/#
```

As you can see, exec a Pod is equivalent to ssh logging into the container. Then, we analyze the processing of IO requests in Kubernetes and the role that CRI Manager plays in the execution flow of kubectl exec.

As shown in picture above, the steps to execute a kubectl exec command are as follows:

1. The essence of the `kubectl exec` command is to execute an exec command on a container in the Kubernetes cluster and forward the resulting IO stream to the user. The request will first be forwarded to the Kubelet of the node of the container located, and the Kubelet will then call the `Exec` port in the CRI according to the configuration. The requested configuration parameters are as follows:
    
    ```go
    type ExecRequest struct {
    	ContainerId string	// Execute the target container of exec
    	Cmd []string	// Specific execution of the exec command
    	Tty bool	// Whether to execute the exec command in a TTY
    	Stdin bool	// Whether include Stdin flow
    	Stdout bool	// Whether to include Stdout flow
    	Stderr bool	// Whether to include Stderr flow 
    }
    ```
2. Surprisingly, CRI Manager's `Exec` method does not directly call Container Manager and execute the exec command on the target container, but instead calls the built-in Stream Server's `GetExec`.
3. The working of Stream Server's `GetExec` method is saving the contents of the exec request to the Request Cache shown above and return a token. Using this token, we can retrieve the corresponding exec request from the Request Cache again. Finally, write the token to a URL and return as a result layer to the ApiServer.
4. ApiServer using the returned URL directly initiate an http request to the Stream Server of the node of the target container. The request header contains the "Upgrade" field, which is required to upgrade the http protocol to a streaming protocol such as websocket or SPDY to support the processing of multiple IO streams. This article takes SPDY as an example.
5. The Stream Server processes the request sent by the ApiServer. First according to the token in the URL, the previously saved exec request configuration is obtained from the Request Cache. Then reply to the http request, agree to upgrade the protocol to SPDY, and wait for the ApiServer creating a specified number of streams according to the configuration of the exec request, corresponding to standard input Stdin, standard output Stdout, standard error output Stderr.
6. After the Stream Server obtains the specified number of Streams, call the Container Manager's `CreateExec` and `startExec` methods in turn, performed the exec operation on the target container, and forwarded the IO stream to the corresponding stream.
7. Finally, the ApiServer forwards the data of each stream to the user, and starts the IO interaction between the user and the target container.

In fact, before introducing of CRI, Kubernetes handled the IO in the same way as we expected. Kubelet will execute the exec command directly on the target container and forward the IO stream back to the ApiServer. Kubelet will bearing too much pressure, because all IO streams need to be forwarded through it, which is obviously unnecessary. Therefore, although the above processing is complicated at first glance, it effectively alleviates the pressure of Kubelet and makes the processing of IO more efficient.

### 7. Summary

This paper begins with the reason of introducing of CRI, briefly describes the architecture of CRI, and focuses on the implementation of PouchContainer's core functional modules. The presence of CRI makes it easier and faster for PouchContainer containers to join the Kubernetes ecosystem. We also believe that the unique features of PouchContainer will definitely make the Kubernetes ecosystem more diverse.
